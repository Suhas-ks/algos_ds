The purpose of this repo is that of an archive and nothing more.
This is just a collection of algorithms and data structures implementation according to assignment problems in the non-credit courses offered by UCSD on edX and coursera. To make use of it, you have to dig into the code yourself, which would be actually very easy
Cheers!!
